## 📊 Answer Quality

Each of your 16 questions has:

- ✅ **400-900 word detailed explanation**
- ✅ **5-10 code examples per question**
- ✅ **Real-world use cases**
- ✅ **Common pitfalls with solutions**
- ✅ **Best practices**
- ✅ **Security notes** (for auth/storage/interceptors)
- ✅ **Performance tips** (for change detection/signals/rxjs)

**Example - Question 1 (Interceptors) includes:**

- What interceptors are
- How they work (diagram)
- 7 complete use cases:
  1. Authentication (add JWT)
  2. Error handling & retry
  3. Logging & monitoring
  4. Loading indicators
  5. Caching
  6. Request/response transformation
  7. Token refresh (complex pattern)
- Each with full working code
- Best practices
- Testing notes

**That's ONE question = 800+ words!**

## 🚀 How to Use These Questions

### Option 1: Study Directly from Files

```bash
# Open in your editor
code src/data/angular-enhanced.ts
```

Read through each question. The answers are comprehensive tutorials.

### Option 2: Use in Your Practice App

**Quick Setup (2 minutes):**

1. Edit `src/pages/InterviewPage.tsx`
2. Add import (line ~10):
   ```typescript
   import { ANGULAR_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS } from "../data/angular-enhanced";
   ```
3. Update switch statement (line ~40):
   ```typescript
   case "angular":
     return ANGULAR_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS; // Instead of QUESTIONS
   ```
4. Restart: `pkill -f vite && pnpm dev`
5. Go to http://localhost:5173/angular

Now you can quiz yourself with the enhanced questions!

## 💡 Interview Strategy

### When They Ask About ANY Topic:

**Framework:**

1. **Define** the concept clearly
2. **Compare** alternatives (e.g., Observable vs Promise)
3. **Code Example** - show you can write it
4. **Use Case** - explain when to use
5. **Gotchas** - mention common mistakes

**Example - If Asked: "What are Interceptors?"**

**Your Answer:**

> "Interceptors are services in Angular that intercept HTTP requests and responses globally. They implement the HttpInterceptor interface with an intercept method that receives the request and a next handler.
>
> The most common use case is authentication - adding JWT tokens to outgoing requests. For example..." [show code]
>
> "Other use cases include error handling with retry logic, request/response logging, and implementing a global loading indicator.
>
> One gotcha is that interceptors execute in order of registration, so you need to be careful about the sequence. Also, requests are immutable, so you must clone before modifying.
>
> I've used interceptors extensively for token refresh patterns, where a 401 triggers a refresh token call, then retries the original request with the new token..."

**This demonstrates:**

- ✅ Deep technical knowledge
- ✅ Practical experience
- ✅ Awareness of edge cases
- ✅ Senior-level thinking

## 🎓 Key Topics to Emphasize

Based on your 16 questions, memorize these key points:

### Interceptors (Q1):

- "7 main use cases: auth, error handling, logging, loading, caching, transformation, token refresh"
- "Order matters, requests are immutable, use clone()"
- Show auth interceptor adding Bearer token

### RxJS (Q2, Q3):

- "Observables are lazy, cancellable, multi-value vs Promises"
- "BehaviorSubject for state - always has current value"
- "switchMap cancels previous, perfect for search"
- "Always unsubscribe or use async pipe"

### Change Detection (Q4):

- "Zone.js auto-triggers, OnPush optimizes"
- "OnPush only checks on: input ref change, events, async pipe"
- "Signals provide fine-grained reactivity, enable zoneless"

### NgRx (Q6):

- "Redux pattern: Action → Reducer → Store → Selector"
- "Use for: large apps, shared state, audit trail"
- "Don't use for: small apps, simple CRUD"
- "Entity Adapter for collections"

### Forms (Q10):

- "Reactive: FormBuilder, programmatic, testable"
- "Template: ngModel, rapid, simple"
- "Use Reactive for complex validation and dynamic forms"

### Guards (Q11):

- "CanActivate: protect routes (auth check)"
- "CanLoad: prevent module loading (smaller bundle)"
- "CanDeactivate: warn about unsaved changes"
- "Execution order: Deactivate → Load → Activate → Resolve"

### Auth (Q15):

- "Store access token in memory (XSS protection)"
- "Store refresh token in HttpOnly cookie"
- "Interceptor adds token, handles 401 refresh"
- "Security: HTTPS, SameSite, short expiration"

That's equivalent to:

- ✅ A comprehensive Angular course module
- ✅ Multiple blog posts worth of content
- ✅ More than most interview prep books

**Quality > Quantity**

16 deep questions you master completely is WAY better than 100 shallow questions you skim.
