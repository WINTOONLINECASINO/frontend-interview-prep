## 🔧 Development

### **Code Quality & Validation**

This project includes a comprehensive pre-push validation system that ensures code quality before changes reach the repository.

#### **Pre-Push Validation Script**

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation (automatically runs on git push)
pnpm pre-push

# Individual validation checks
pnpm check:any          # Find any types in source code
pnpm check:unused       # Find unused variables
pnpm check:console      # Find console.log statements
```

#### **Standard Development Commands**

```bash
# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Lint with strict rules (zero warnings)
pnpm lint:strict

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Format code
pnpm format

# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Validate everything
pnpm validate
```

### **Pre-Push Validation Features**

The validation system automatically checks:

- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Ensures no type errors
- ✅ **ESLint Quality**: Enforces coding standards
- ✅ **Prettier Formatting**: Consistent code formatting
- ✅ **Production Build**: Verifies build success
- ✅ **Test Suite**: Runs all tests
- ✅ **Any Type Detection**: Finds `any` types (excluding example code)
- ✅ **Unused Variables**: Identifies unused variables and imports
- ✅ **Console Statements**: Detects `console.log` usage

### **Architecture Improvements**

The codebase has been refactored with clean architecture principles:

- **Custom Hooks**: `useFrameworkManager`, `useQuestionNavigation`, `useProgressManager`
- **Services**: `FrameworkService`, `QuestionService` for business logic
- **Context API**: `SidebarContext` for state management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Component Composition**: Reusable table components and utilities
