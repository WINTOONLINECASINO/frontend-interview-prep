# React Enhanced Questions - Status & Usage Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Created

You now have **`src/data/react-enhanced.ts`** with **10 comprehensive, interview-ready React questions**.

### Current Questions (Deep Dive Format):

1. **Virtual DOM** - Complete explanation with benefits, limitations, and internal workings
2. **Reconciliation & Diffing Algorithm** - Key heuristics, O(n) optimization, code examples
3. **React Fiber Architecture** - Why it exists, how it works, concurrent rendering
4. **Portals** - Use cases, accessibility, focus management, pitfalls
5. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components** - When to use each, performance, patterns
6. **Context API** - Performance problems, optimization strategies, when to use
7. **Component Lifecycle** - Full mapping from class to hooks
8. **Rules of Hooks** - Why they exist, internal implementation, common mistakes
9. **useEffect vs useLayoutEffect** - Timing differences, use cases, SSR considerations
10. **Keys in Lists** - Why critical, index-as-key problems, real-world bugs

## üìä Answer Quality

Each question includes:

- ‚úÖ **400-600 word detailed answers**
- ‚úÖ **Multiple code examples** (wrong ‚ùå vs right ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ **Real-world use cases**
- ‚úÖ **Common pitfalls and how to avoid them**
- ‚úÖ **Performance implications**
- ‚úÖ **Best practices**
- ‚úÖ **Proper categorization** (category, difficulty, tags)

## üéØ How to Use This File

### Option 1: Replace Current Questions (Recommended for Deep Study)

```typescript
// In your InterviewPage.tsx or data loader
case 'react':
  const { REACT_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS } = await import('./data/react-enhanced');
  return REACT_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS;
```

**Pros:**

- Deep, comprehensive answers
- Perfect for senior interview prep
- Self-contained learning

**Cons:**

- Only 10 questions vs 100
- More reading per question

### Option 2: Add as Bonus "Deep Dive" Category

Keep both files:

- `react.ts` - 100 quick questions for breadth
- `react-enhanced.ts` - 10 deep questions for depth

Add a toggle in your UI for "Quick Review" vs "Deep Dive" mode.

### Option 3: Merge Approach

Replace the first 10 questions in `react.ts` with these enhanced versions, keep remaining 90 for breadth.

## üìö Critical Topics Still to Add (15 More)

To complete a comprehensive set of 25 interview questions, add:

1. **Error Boundaries** - Implementation, limitations, async handling
2. **useMemo & useCallback** - When to use, performance cost, pitfalls
3. **React.memo** - HOC for performance, custom comparison
4. **StrictMode** - What it checks, double-invocation, development tool
5. **useTransition** - Concurrent features, non-urgent updates
6. **Suspense** - Data fetching, streaming SSR, boundaries
7. **useState vs useReducer** - When to use each, complex state
8. **useRef** - DOM refs, mutable values, useImperativeHandle
9. **Custom Hooks** - Design patterns, API design, testing
10. **Performance Optimization** - Profiling, React DevTools, strategies
11. **Code Splitting** - React.lazy, dynamic imports, Suspense
12. **React 18 Features** - Automatic batching, concurrent rendering
13. **Server Components (RSC)** - Architecture, benefits, limitations
14. **Testing** - RTL philosophy, testing hooks, mocking
15. **Security** - XSS, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, CSP, sanitization

## üöÄ Recommendation

### For Your Interview Prep:

**If interview is soon (< 1 week):**

- ‚úÖ Use these 10 questions for fundamentals
- ‚úÖ Skim the 100 questions in react.ts for breadth
- ‚úÖ Focus on topics you're weakest on

**If you have more time (2+ weeks):**

- I can add 10-15 more deep-dive questions
- Cover all critical React topics
- You'll have complete senior-level coverage

## üìñ Using in Your App

To switch to enhanced questions:

1. Update `src/pages/InterviewPage.tsx`:

```typescript
// Find the switch statement around line 40
const allFrameworkQuestions = useMemo(() => {
  switch (selectedFramework) {
    case "nextjs":
      return NEXTJS_QUESTIONS;
    case "react":
      return REACT_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS; // Change this line!
    case "redux":
      return REDUX_QUESTIONS;
    default:
      return QUESTIONS;
  }
}, [selectedFramework]);
```

2. Add import:

```typescript
import { REACT_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS } from "../data/react-enhanced";
```

3. Restart dev server

## üí° Quick Test

Want to see how these look in your app right now?

```bash
# In your terminal
cd /Users/htirawi/Desktop/angular-test
```

Then edit `src/pages/InterviewPage.tsx` as shown above, and you'll see the enhanced questions when you select React!

## ‚ùì Next Steps

**Choose one:**

A. ‚úÖ "These 10 are enough, let me study them" - Use as-is
B. üöÄ "Add 10-15 more critical topics" - I'll complete the set
C. üîÑ "Add just 5 more on [specific topics]" - Tell me which topics

**Let me know and I'll continue!** üéì
