## üöÄ How to Use for Your Interview

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Questions in Your App (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Update `src/pages/InterviewPage.tsx`

Find this section (around line 39):

```typescript
const allFrameworkQuestions = useMemo(() => {
  switch (selectedFramework) {
    case "nextjs":
      return NEXTJS_QUESTIONS;
    case "react":
      return REACT_QUESTIONS; // Change this!
    case "redux":
      return REDUX_QUESTIONS;
    default:
      return QUESTIONS; // Change this!
  }
}, [selectedFramework]);
```

**Change to:**

```typescript
const allFrameworkQuestions = useMemo(() => {
  switch (selectedFramework) {
    case "angular":
      return ANGULAR_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS; // Use enhanced!
    case "nextjs":
      return NEXTJS_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS;
    case "react":
      return REACT_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS; // Use enhanced!
    case "redux":
      return REDUX_QUESTIONS;
    default:
      return ANGULAR_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS;
  }
}, [selectedFramework]);
```

**Step 2:** Add imports at the top:

```typescript
import { ANGULAR_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS } from "../data/angular-enhanced";
import { REACT_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS } from "../data/react-enhanced";
import { NEXTJS_ENHANCED_QUESTIONS } from "../data/nextjs-enhanced";
```

**Step 3:** Restart dev server

```bash
pkill -f vite && pnpm dev
```

**Step 4:** Test

- Go to http://localhost:5173
- Select Angular framework
- See comprehensive questions with detailed answers!

### Option 2: Study from Files Directly

Open these files in your editor and read:

- `src/data/angular-enhanced.ts`
- `src/data/react-enhanced.ts`

Each question has full explanations you can study directly.

## üìñ What Each File Contains

### angular-enhanced.ts (Current: 7 questions)

**Question 1: HTTP Interceptors**

- What they are and how they work
- 7 common use cases with full code:
