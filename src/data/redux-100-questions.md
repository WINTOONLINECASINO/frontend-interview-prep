# Redux & Redux Toolkit (RTK, RTK Query, Middleware) — 100 Mock Interview Questions with Senior-Level Answers

---

### 1) Why Redux in modern apps? When is it overkill?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Predictable transitions & tooling; great for large teams and cross-cutting workflows.
- Overkill for localized UI state—prefer component state or light stores.

### 2) Redux Toolkit—what problems does it solve?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Reduces boilerplate; safe immutability via Immer; standard patterns for store setup and async flows.

### 3) Immer in reducers—how does it work?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Draft state proxies record mutations and produce immutable next state; reducers remain pure and testable.

### 4) Selectors & memoization?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Derived data in one place; memo avoids recompute and re-renders; test selectors cheaply.

### 5) RTK Query vs. thunks?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- RTKQ for fetching/caching/invalidations; thunks for arbitrary side-effects and workflows.

### 6) Designing slice boundaries?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Group by domain; keep actions semantic; avoid tight coupling; normalize entities.

### 7) Normalization & entity adapters?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Use `createEntityAdapter` for CRUD; selectors for lookup & memoization; IDs in UI state.

### 8) Middleware—top use cases?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Logging, analytics, feature flags, auth refresh, websocket bridges; keep deterministic.

### 9) Performance with Redux?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Narrow `useSelector` scopes; stable references; memoized selectors; avoid massive root subscriptions.

### 10) Testing reducers, thunks, and middleware?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Reducers: pure snapshots; thunks/middleware: mocked store, fake timers/events, assert dispatched actions.

### 11) Error handling strategy?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Represent error states in slices; map to user-facing messages; centralize retry/backoff policy.

### 12) Code splitting & lazy reducers?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Inject reducers on route mount; eject on unmount if appropriate; keep store lean.

### 13) Persistence & migrations?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Persist selected slices; version schemas and write migrations; encrypt sensitive data.

### 14) WebSocket + Redux architecture?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Middleware translating socket events <-> actions; debounce bursts; handle reconnection.

### 15) RSC/Next.js integration?

**Answer (senior-level):**

- Hydrate store from server payload; minimize client bundle by code-splitting slices and using RTKQ for data.
