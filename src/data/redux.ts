  {
    id: 1,
    question: `Why Redux in modern apps? When is it overkill?`,
    answer: `Predictable transitions & tooling; great for large teams and cross-cutting workflows.
Overkill for localized UI state—prefer component state or light stores.`,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: `Redux Toolkit—what problems does it solve?`,
    answer: `Reduces boilerplate; safe immutability via Immer; standard patterns for store setup and async flows.`,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: `Immer in reducers—how does it work?`,
    answer: `Draft state proxies record mutations and produce immutable next state; reducers remain pure and testable.`,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: `Selectors & memoization?`,
    answer: `Derived data in one place; memo avoids recompute and re-renders; test selectors cheaply.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: `RTK Query vs. thunks?`,
    answer: `RTKQ for fetching/caching/invalidations; thunks for arbitrary side-effects and workflows.`,
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: `Designing slice boundaries?`,
    answer: `Group by domain; keep actions semantic; avoid tight coupling; normalize entities.`,
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: `Normalization & entity adapters?`,
    answer: `Use \`createEntityAdapter\` for CRUD; selectors for lookup & memoization; IDs in UI state.`,
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: `Middleware—top use cases?`,
    answer: `Logging, analytics, feature flags, auth refresh, websocket bridges; keep deterministic.`,
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: `Performance with Redux?`,
    answer: `Narrow \`useSelector\` scopes; stable references; memoized selectors; avoid massive root subscriptions.`,
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: `Testing reducers, thunks, and middleware?`,
    answer: `Reducers: pure snapshots; thunks/middleware: mocked store, fake timers/events, assert dispatched actions.`,
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: `Error handling strategy?`,
    answer: `Represent error states in slices; map to user-facing messages; centralize retry/backoff policy.`,
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: `Code splitting & lazy reducers?`,
    answer: `Inject reducers on route mount; eject on unmount if appropriate; keep store lean.`,
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: `Persistence & migrations?`,
    answer: `Persist selected slices; version schemas and write migrations; encrypt sensitive data.`,
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: `WebSocket + Redux architecture?`,
    answer: `Middleware translating socket events <-> actions; debounce bursts; handle reconnection.`,
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: `RSC/Next.js integration?`,
    answer: `Hydrate store from server payload; minimize client bundle by code-splitting slices and using RTKQ for data.`,
  },
